Problem 1
---------

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

``` r
# load and clean data
df_birthweight = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(  # convert numeric to factor 
    babysex = factor(babysex), 
    frace = factor(frace),
    malform = factor(malform), 
    mrace = factor(mrace) 
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_integer(),
    ##   gaweeks = col_double(),
    ##   ppbmi = col_double(),
    ##   smoken = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
# check for missing data
anyNA(df_birthweight)
```

    ## [1] FALSE

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two. Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals against fitted values â€“ use add\_predictions and add\_residuals in making this plot.
