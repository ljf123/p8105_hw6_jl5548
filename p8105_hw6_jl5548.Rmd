## Problem 1

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

```{r}
# load and clean variable names
df_birthweight = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 

# tidy data and store in another dataframe
df_birthweight_tidy = df_birthweight %>% 
  mutate(  # convert numeric to factor, and categorize to corresponding label
    babysex = factor(
      case_when(
        babysex == 1 ~ "male",
        babysex == 2 ~ "female"
      )
    ), 
    frace = factor(
      case_when(
        frace == 1 ~ "White",
        frace == 2 ~ "Black",
        frace == 3 ~ "Asian",
        frace == 4 ~ "Puerto Rican",
        frace == 8 ~ "Other",
        frace == 9 ~ "Unknown"
      )
    ),
    malform = factor(
      case_when(
        malform == 0 ~ "absent",
        malform == 1 ~ "present"
      )
    ), 
    mrace = factor(
      case_when(
        mrace == 1 ~ "White",
        mrace == 2 ~ "Black",
        mrace == 3 ~ "Asian",
        mrace == 4 ~ "Puerto Rican",
        mrace == 8 ~ "Other"
      )
    )
  )

# check for missing data
anyNA(df_birthweight)

# display tidied dataset
df_birthweight_tidy
```

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two. Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals against fitted values â€“ use add_predictions and add_residuals in making this plot.
